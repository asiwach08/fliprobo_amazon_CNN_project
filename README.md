# fliprobo_amazon_CNN_project
      Images are one of the major sources of data in the field of data science and AI. This field is making appropriate use of information that can be gathered through images by examining its features and details. We are trying to give  an exposure of how an end to end project is developed in this field. 
The idea behind this project is to build a deep learning-based Image Classification model on images that will be scraped from e-commerce portal. This is done to make the model more and more robust.
